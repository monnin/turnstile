Packet Format for Commands and Responses

  Commands: 
    <cmd:8bitchar>[<path:0-511bytes]>

  Responses: 
    <resp:8bitchar><transaction-id-or-errorcode:8bitint>[<data:0-510bytes]

Commands:

   Since the path might take multiple packets, multiple 
   "prefix" packets can be sent ahead of time

   C<trans-id:8bitint>	- Get the next packet in a larger response

   G<path> - Get a file (can use multiple "P" packets prior)
   	(Returns an error code if the path is not a [normal] file)

   K<path> - Return the destination if path is a symbolic link
		(returns an empty packet if valid, but not a symlink)

   L<path> - Perform a "ls" on a directory (nominally)
   	If path is a directory:
   	Returns the name (but not the full path) of all files/dirs in 
		that dir (non-recursively)
   	(\0 between items)
   	If a path is a file:
   		Returns two \0\0 if the file exists
   	If a path is neither a file nor directory:
   		Returns an error code	

   M - Get MaxPacket (set by server or relay)
	(returns packet size as a 32-bit number)

   N[<data>] - NoOp - Does nothing on the relay/server, but has a valid 
		response packet.  

		Relay special case: If data is a NUL (or is not present),
		then the relay answers the NoOp, otherwise it forwards the
		request to the server (that way a client can check both 
		entities)

   Q<prio> - Set the priority of the connection 
	(used by the relay, ignored by the server)

   S<path> - Stat a file/dir - 
      Return a (limited) stat() of a file or directory 
	(a directory returns a single item)
  	(Returns an error code if the path is not a file or directory)
   	(Returns flags, mode, size, mtime, ctime) 
		# Mode does NOT include file type
		(flags: LSB (1) = dir, (0) = file)
		(flags: MSB (1) = symlink, (0) = not symlink)

   Z - Reset - Clears/deletes all partial transfers 
	(aka incomplete transactions)

   P<ppath> - Prefix (of a path) - Allows for paths > 511 bytes long
   	Since the path might take multiple packets, multiple 
	"prefix" packets can be sent ahead of actual command packet.  
  	(e.g. P<path1>, P<path2>, G<path3> would request a "get" 
		operation with a longerr file path)
   
  	Server responds with a "c" (continue) packet



Reponses:

   c - Continue - used only with "P" packets
   d<id><data>	- Data packet with more data available after this packet
   l<id>[<data>]	Data packet with no more data available 
			(the last packet - completes the transaction)
			(an empty data section is pemitted)
   z<id> - Error response to command


Turnstile over UDP:

   Uses the exact same protocol but prepends an 8bit sequence #

   Cmds:  <net-seq-num:8bit><cmd:8bit><trans-id:8bit>[<data...>]
