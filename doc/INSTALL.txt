Turnstile is designed to not need many external dependencies.

SERVER:

1. Extract the entire contents of the .tar file into a directory (e.g. /usr/local/turnstile)

   (e.g.  cd /usr/local; sudo tar xfp /tmp/turnstile.tar)

2. Make sure that the USB OTG port is configured within the O/S.  On a Raspberry Pi, the command is often:

	dtoverlay dcw2

3. Turnstile will automatically load the module for "gadgetfs" if necessary, but if you wish to use
   FunctionFS/ConfigFS, you will need to load the module and create the directory.


BOOTSTRAPPING the CLIENT:

Only two files should be necessary to be transferred to the client ahead of time.   The turnstile source code
(aka "turnstile.tar") and the Python3 module to support libusb1 (which is often called python3-usb1).

1. For a Debian-based system (e.g. Raspbian or Ubuntu), prestage the appropriate .deb file for python3-usb1 for
your specific distribution.

2. Pre-stage turnstile.tar onto the system and install it into a directory (e.g. /usr/local/turnstile)

3. Install the python3-usb1.deb file using the "dpkg -i" command

4. You do not need to install the dtoverlay, nor do you need to install gadetfs, configfs, or functionfs 
(those are only needed on the server)


5. The base client should now be functional, although you will need additional modules for the web front end (e.g. "flask")
You can now use the "t-rcp -u" and "t-ls -u" commands to copy any other files you need.
