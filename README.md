# Turnstile - A Unidirectional System for Medium-Security Isolated Clusters

Turnstile implements a secure method to copy files into an (otherwise) isolated computing cluster.  
It uses a single USB connection between two computers (physical or virtual) and limits the the types of permitted communication 
using a few different techniques.  While it has many use cases, it is not intended for high-security settings.
